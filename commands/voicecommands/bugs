SERVER ISSUES:

Certain crashes need fixing, unable to fix as of right now

KNOWN BUGS: 

Aliases for !volume not working
Add !leave allias to !stop
Add skip message when skipped was succesful and autodelete AFTER 10 sec
Add a leave command (Empty queue => not playing => !stop being undefined -> can't leave)
Add an !earrape command (Bassboost effect + high volume)
Add !help command
Seeking to a position outside the song makes the bot get stuck in a loop

BUG FIXES;

Using !jump to a position that isn't in the queue made the bot crash, error not being caught by 'catch'. Fixed issues by checking if the args[0] was a valid position in the queue.
Capped volume at 1000,99% to ensure no one's ears start bleeding.
